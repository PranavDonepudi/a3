#Boole's Example 5
# To solve the problem, we can use the splitting method. 
#This method works by recursively splitting the Boolean algebra into smaller and smaller sub-algebras, until we reach a point where we can easily solve the problem for each sub-algebra.
#From the knowledge that a production has property A, we can infer that it also has property B and property D. We cannot infer anything about property C.
#From the knowledge that a production has property B, we can infer that it also has property A. We can also infer that it has property C or property D, but we cannot infer which one.
